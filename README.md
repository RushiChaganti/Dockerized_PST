# Password Strength Tester (PST)

Welcome to the Password Strength Tester (PST) project repository! PST is a tool to evaluate the strength of passwords.

## Overview

This project provides a Dockerized setup for running the Password Strength Tester application using Streamlit. Due to the limitation of uploading larger files to GitHub, we have containerized the necessary files and dependencies to ensure easy access and execution of the project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Usage

To run the Password Strength Tester application locally using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
         git clone https://github.com/RushiChaganti/PST.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
         cd password-strength-tester
3. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:
         docker-compose up -d
4.Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Password Strength Tester application in your web browser at:
        http://localhost:8501
Note

Due to the inability to upload larger files, we have containerized the necessary files and dependencies. If you have any questions or encounter any issues while running the project, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
